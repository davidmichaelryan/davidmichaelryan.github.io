        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>My name is David Ryan, and I'm a recent graduate from Northwestern University with a degree Computer Science, focusing on interfaces and artificial intelligence. I've come to love web development that can provide both metric-driven and holistic improvements to the ~user experience~. I'm also a huge fan of longreads, basketball, and weird Twitter.</p>

          <h1>GROUPON</h1>
          <p>I had a chance to put this interest to good use at Groupon's headquarters in Chicago, as a software engineer intern for the 'Funnel Optimization' team. I'm happy to say that I'm now working there full time.</p>

      <h2>Northwestern Dance Marathon</h2>
      <p>I can't say how excited I am for the upcoming school year, where I will be one of the Executive Co-Chairs (aka Head Honchos) for <a href="http://nudm.org">Northwestern University Dance Marathon</a>. We led a group of 22 other Executive Board members and over 1400 students in raising over $1 million for the Starlight Children's Foundation and Evanston Community Foundation.</p>

      <p>I was lucky enough to previously be on the board as a Technology Resources Co-Chair. I made a recap of 2014 <a href="recap/index.html">here</a>. Check it out!</p>

      <h2>Other work</h2>
      <p>I've done some other cool projects while at Northwestern - here are some I'm particularly proud of: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Mayfest</h4>
          <p>In spring 2015, I converted a simple html website for Mayfest's <a href="http://dilloday.com">Dillo Day</a> into a full-fledged, CMS-backed Node.js website using Keystone.js. It uses modern developer tools including Sass, Coffeescript, Mustache, and Grunt to create a modern, future-forward site for the festival.</p>
          <p>Earlier, I was the sole developer for the first ever Dillo Day iOS app. I managed to hack it together in Spring 2014 using Appgyver's Steroids IDE.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>A&amp;O</h4>
          <p>I work on the website for <a href="http://aoproductions.net">A&amp;O Productions</a>, a student group on campus that brings artists and speakers to campus. One of my main tasks is designing cool splash pages for their announcements. My favorite is from this past spring, when NUDM and A&amp;O teamed up for a Benefit Concert that featured Magic Man and Cheers Elephant. I've saved the splash page <a href="benefit/index.html">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Random Pocket</h4>
          <p>Between Twitter, Facebook, my daily pilgrimage to Grantland, and the endless other sources of entertainment on the Internet, I'm constantly bombarded with different stories, videos, and programming tips. <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> is a great tool to save all these links and revisit them when I have time, but it can quickly get overwhelming. <a href="http://randompocket.herokuapp.com">Random Pocket</a> is an attempt to help me get through it all.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Is Ja Rule Ok?</h4>
          <p>Because the world needs to know whether or not everyone's favorite early-2000s Hip Hop mogul is <a href="http://isjaruleok.com">doing ok</a>.</p>
        </li>
