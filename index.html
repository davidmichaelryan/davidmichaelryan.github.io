      <article>
        <h3>Software Development Engineer III</h3>
        <h4>Groupon, Inc</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>My work centers on the Deal Page team, which owns the deal details page on the main purchase flow of <a href="https://groupon.com">groupon.com</a>. I implement features and experiments, review code from team members and external contributors, resolve bugs, and work on the server &amp; client side to provide a better consumer experience. Recently, I've focused on improving latency and providing better analytical tools for developers.</li>
          <li>My day-to-day work includes: writing Javascript on Node applications (and using Preact when it's helpful), polishing our layouts using Stylus, and ensuring that incoming code is up to our standards using Github.</li>

        <h3>Executive Co-Chair</h3>
        <h4>Northwestern University Dance Marathon</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I spent most of my senior year at NU leading 20 other Executive Board members and over 1400 students in fundraising &amp; spreading awareness for the <a href="http://starlight.org">Starlight Children's Foundation</a> &amp; <a href="http://evanstonforever.org">Evanston Community Foundation</a>.</li>
          <li>We raised $1.13 million for our beneficiaries, the second highest cash total in the organization's history. The money has been committed to building 11 <a href="http://starlight.org/starlightsites">Starlight Sites</a> in Chicagoland area hospitals and providing capacity building &amp; programming grants through the ECF <a href="http://evanstonforever.org/grants/responsive-grants/">Responsive Grants Program</a>.</li>
