        | In the summer of 2015, I began working at Groupon as a Software Development Engineer. I'm currently on the Funnel Optimization team, which maintains the Deal Page and User Sessions platforms for #[a(href="http://groupon.com") groupon.com] . I implement features and experiments, resolve bugs, and work on the server &amp; client side to provide a better consumer experience.
